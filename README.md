Code of the paper: "A predictive hybrid reduced order model based on proper orthogonal decomposition combined with deep learning architectures"

This repository contains the code and dataset files for the paper: "A predictive hybrid reduced order model based on proper orthogonal decomposition combined with deep learning architectures", R. Abadia-Heredia, M. Lopez-Martin, B. Carro, J.I. Arribas, J.M. Perez and S. Le Clainche.

All code files are available in this (github) repository. The description of the different files is as follows:

1. kkkkk
2. kkkkkk

The code is prepared to make predicitions with k snapshots used as predicitors to predict p time-ahead snaphots. In particular, in the code are used: p = 6 and k = 10. The results included in the paper present only the first time-ahead prediction (of the p available).

The code can be executed in the cloud using Google Colaboratory https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
